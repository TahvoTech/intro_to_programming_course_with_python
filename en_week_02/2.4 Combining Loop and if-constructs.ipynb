    "Programming in high-level language is basically a creative process, where the control structures are combined to solve problems. The structures can be located one after another or within each other. Successive structures may be independent from each other, while nested structures usually co-operate closely. Nested structures have been discussed earlier in connection with the nested selection structures and the flag variables, whose values were flipped using a if statement inside a while statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection nested in a loop is a typical combination of different control structures. The reverse order is also possible: Selection can enclose a loop. Different structures are often more than two-layers deep. Also multilayered structures are connected to each other with indents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire program, or most of it, may be inside so called main loop that is usually controlled by a flag variable. The main loop often contains a selection structure that directs the program execution to different paths according to userâ€™s inputs. The main loop prevents the program from ending after a selected execution path has been travelled by returning the execution back to the selection. The selection may have an option to stop the loop or there may be a separate selection structure for the decicion to continue or stop the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit conversion program shown below has a main loop. The user enters the conversion direction and the if-elif-else selects and performs the corresponding conversion unless the choice is invalid."
