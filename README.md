# Programming 1: Introduction to Programming (Python)

This repository contains my work and exercises for the **Programming 1: Introduction to Programming** course, which is part of my [university/college name] studies. The course focuses on introducing core programming concepts using Python.

## Course Overview

The course covers the basics of Python programming, including:

- Variables and control structures (if-else, loops, etc.)
- Dividing programs into functions
- Lists, dictionaries, and basic file handling
- Introduction to object-oriented programming
- Good programming practices

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, I will have learned how to:
- Understand basic programming concepts (variables, control structures, functions)
- Use lists and dictionaries
- Combine basic data structures to create nested structures
- Design and test small programs
- Understand the basics of classes and objects (OOP)

## Folder Structure

The repository is divided into folders based on the course weeks. Each folder contains Python scripts and exercises for that week’s topics.

python-course-repo/ 
├── week1_basics/ 
├── week2_loops/ 
├── week3_functions/ 
└── week4_oop/

## Running the Code

Each folder contains `.py` files that can be executed using Python 3.x. To run a file, navigate to the respective folder and use the following command:

```bash
python filename.py

## Good Programming Practices

The course emphasizes:

    Writing readable and maintainable code
    Following proper naming conventions
    Using comments and documentation for clarity

## Topics Covered

    Variables and data types
    Control structures (if, loops)
    Functions (passing parameters, return values)
    Lists, dictionaries, sets
    Basic file handling
    Object-oriented programming (classes, objects)
    Nested data structures
    Special methods, function parameters, tuples
