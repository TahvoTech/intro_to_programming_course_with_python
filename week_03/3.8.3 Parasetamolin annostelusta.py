Program calculates the amount of Parasetamol to give to the patient.

Examples:

Patient's weight (kg): 50
How much time has passed from the previous dose (full hours): 6
The total dose for the last 24 hours (mg): 750
The amount of Parasetamol to give to the patient: 750

Patient's weight (kg): 80
How much time has passed from the previous dose (full hours): 7
The total dose for the last 24 hours (mg): 3600
The amount of Parasetamol to give to the patient: 400

Patient's weight (kg): 67
How much time has passed from the previous dose (full hours): 4
The total dose for the last 24 hours (mg): 1000
The amount of Parasetamol to give to the patient: 0
