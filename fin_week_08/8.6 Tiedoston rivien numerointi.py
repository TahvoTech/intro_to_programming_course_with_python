"""
This script reads lines from a file named 'text.txt', strips trailing newline characters from each line,
and prints each line prefixed with its line number. The line numbers start from 1 and increment for each line.

The script demonstrates basic file reading and line numbering in Python without using the built-in enumerate function.
